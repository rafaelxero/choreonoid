The current latest version of the Eigen libary is 3.3.x, but version 3.2.x is
bundlded with Choreonoid because it performs better with Visual C++ compiler.
The details of it is described in the following discussion of stackoverflow:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44300581/eigen-library-eigenvalue-computation-performance-gcc-vs-visual-studio-2015

The bundled version is used to build Choreonoid when VC++ is used unless the
Eigen directory is explicitly specified in the EIGEN_DIR variable of CMake.
On other environments including Ubuntu Linux, the Eigen library installed
in the system is used unless the EIGEN_DIR is explicitly specified.
